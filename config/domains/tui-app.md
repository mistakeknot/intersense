# TUI App Domain Profile

## Detection Signals

Primary signals (strong indicators):
- Directories: `tui/`, `ui/`, `view/`, `component/`
- Files: `*.go`, `*.rs`
- Frameworks: Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Bubbles, Ratatui, tui-rs, Crossterm, Termion, Blessed, Ink, Rich, Textual
- Keywords: `render`, `update`, `view`, `model`, `msg`, `cmd`, `tea.Model`, `widget`, `layout`, `viewport`

Secondary signals (supporting):
- Directories: `styles/`, `keys/`, `input/`
- Files: `keymap.*`, `theme.*`, `styles.*`
- Keywords: `flex`, `border`, `cursor`, `focus`, `tab_order`, `key_binding`, `ansi`, `escape_sequence`

## Injection Criteria

When `tui-app` is detected, inject these domain-specific review bullets into each core agent's prompt.

### fd-architecture

- Check that UI components follow a unidirectional data flow (Model → View → Update cycle, not bidirectional bindings)
- Verify that business logic is separate from rendering — the Model should be testable without a terminal
- Flag monolithic update functions — each component should handle its own messages with clear delegation
- Check that key bindings are centralized in a keymap, not scattered across components (enables user customization)
- Verify that the layout system handles terminal resize gracefully (components adapt, don't clip or panic)

### fd-safety

- Check that user input is sanitized before display (terminal escape sequences in data could manipulate the UI)
- Verify that file operations from TUI commands validate paths (user-typed paths in file pickers need traversal protection)
- Flag raw terminal mode cleanup — if the app crashes, ensure the terminal is restored (deferred reset on panic)
- Check that clipboard operations don't silently expose sensitive data (password fields shouldn't paste to system clipboard)
- Verify that external command execution from TUI (shell-out) validates and escapes arguments

### fd-correctness

- Check that focus management is consistent — tabbing through elements should follow a predictable, documented order
- Verify that list/table scrolling handles edge cases (empty list, single item, index out of bounds after filter)
- Flag async operations that update the model without going through the message loop (bypasses the update cycle, causes stale views)
- Check that multi-pane layouts maintain independent scroll positions (scrolling in one pane shouldn't affect another)
- Verify that text input handles Unicode correctly (multi-byte characters, combining marks, cursor positioning)

### fd-quality

- Check that style definitions use a theme system, not hardcoded ANSI codes (enables color scheme customization)
- Verify that help text is accessible from every screen (context-sensitive ? or F1 showing available key bindings)
- Flag inconsistent key binding conventions (Ctrl+Q to quit in one view, Esc in another, q in a third)
- Check that status bar or footer communicates current mode, available actions, and any pending operations
- Verify that terminal output is tested (golden file snapshots of rendered output for regression detection)

### fd-performance

- Check that render calls are batched — don't flush to terminal after every small change (causes visible flicker)
- Flag full-screen redraws when only a small region changed (use dirty-region tracking or differential rendering)
- Verify that large lists use virtual scrolling (only render visible rows + buffer, not all 10,000 items)
- Check that key repeat doesn't queue up stale events (fast scrolling shouldn't lag behind with accumulated updates)
- Flag blocking operations in the update loop — network/file IO should be async commands, not synchronous calls

### fd-user-product

- Check that the app has a discoverable command palette or help screen (new users shouldn't need to read docs to navigate)
- Verify that destructive operations show inline confirmation (don't just delete on single keypress without feedback)
- Flag missing visual feedback for state changes (selected item highlighting, active pane indication, loading spinners)
- Check that mouse support is optional and keyboard-first (mouse can enhance but shouldn't be required)
- Verify that the app works in common terminal sizes (80x24 minimum) and degrades gracefully in very small terminals

## Agent Specifications

These are domain-specific agents that `/flux-gen` can generate for TUI app projects. They complement (not replace) the core fd-* agents.

### fd-terminal-rendering

Focus: Render performance, ANSI output correctness, terminal compatibility, visual regression testing.

Persona: You are a terminal rendering specialist — you care about smooth updates, minimal flicker, and correct behavior across terminal emulators from xterm to Windows Terminal.

Decision lens: Prefer rendering correctness across terminals over visual polish on one. A beautiful TUI that breaks on tmux helps nobody.

Key review areas:
- Check renderer updates only dirty regions and avoids full-screen redraws when unnecessary.
- Verify ANSI escape sequences render correctly across supported terminal emulators without state corruption.
- Validate color fallback paths preserve readability and semantic meaning at 256-color, 16-color, and monochrome levels.
- Confirm snapshot tests cover representative screens and fail on unintended visual regressions.
- Ensure resize events trigger stable reflow without clipping, overlap, or orphaned UI artifacts.

### fd-interaction-design

Focus: Key binding consistency, focus management, navigation patterns, accessibility in terminal context.

Persona: You are a TUI interaction designer — you ensure keyboard navigation is intuitive, focus management is predictable, and accessibility isn't an afterthought.

Decision lens: Prefer keyboard-navigable, accessible interactions over mouse-friendly visual layouts. TUI users chose the terminal for a reason.

Key review areas:
- Check keymaps cover primary actions and flag conflicting bindings before release.
- Verify focus traversal order is logical and current focus is always visually apparent.
- Validate modal and modeless flows are consistent and clearly communicate interaction state changes.
- Confirm supported screen-reader modes expose meaningful labels and navigation landmarks.
- Ensure mouse support enhances workflows without breaking keyboard-only operation.

## Research Directives

When `tui-app` is detected, inject these search directives into research agent prompts.

### best-practices-researcher
- Terminal rendering performance and diff-based update strategies
- Keyboard shortcut conventions and keymap design patterns
- Responsive terminal layouts for varying window sizes
- Mouse event handling in terminal applications
- Clipboard integration across terminal emulators and platforms

### framework-docs-researcher
- Bubble Tea/Ratatui/crossterm documentation and component APIs
- ANSI escape code reference and SGR parameter sequences
- Terminal capability detection (terminfo/termcap) and fallback strategies
- Unicode width handling and East Asian character support
- Terminal multiplexer compatibility (tmux, screen) considerations
